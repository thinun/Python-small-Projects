Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Text-to-Speech Project:

Step 1: 

Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
gtts: for text-to-speech conversion
pydub: for audio file manipulation
simpleaudio: for audio playback

Step 2: 

Input Text from the User
Use Python's built-in input() function to prompt the user to enter the text they want to convert to speech.

Step 3: 

Convert Text to Speech
Use the gTTS library to convert the input text to speech.
Save the generated speech as an audio file (e.g., "output.mp3").

Step 4: 

Play the Audio File
Use the simpleaudio library to load and play the generated audio file.
Optionally, you can use other methods or libraries to play the audio file.

Step 5: 

Optional Enhancements
Add error handling to manage potential issues with user input or file operations.
Allow users to choose the language for text-to-speech conversion.
Implement text preprocessing to improve the quality of the generated speech.
